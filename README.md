# boot-hoplon

[](dependency)
```clojure
[tailrecursion/boot-hoplon "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"] ;; latest release
```
[](/dependency)

[Boot] task for building [Hoplon] web applications.

## Usage

Add `boot-hoplon` to your `build.boot` dependencies and `require` the namespace.

> **Note:** the boot-hoplon dependency is only needed at when compiling Hoplon
> source files, but hoplon itself is needed both when compiling and at runtime.
> So you should add boot-hoplon with the _test_ scope and hoplon with the
> (default) _compile_ scope.

```clj
(merge-env!
  :dependencies '[[tailrecursion/hoplon "A.B.C"]
                  [tailrecursion/boot-hoplon "X.Y.Z" :scope "test"])
(require '[tailrecursion.boot-hoplon :refer :all])
```

You can see the options available on the command line:

```bash
boot hoplon -h
```

or in the REPL:

```clj
boot.user=> (doc hoplon)
```

## Compile Hoplon Pages

If you only want to compile Hoplon &rarr; ClojureScript+HTML, you can do:

```bash
boot hoplon
```
